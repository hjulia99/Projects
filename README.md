# Julia's Projects
Welcome! I am a Masters student at Cornell Tech studying Operations Research and Information Engineering. After taking a class in data analytics and learning new skills during my internships, I have developed a passion for data science. A couple things that I am interested in learning more about are machine learning and natural language processing. Here I have uploaded a couple of my favorite class and personal projects.
